House price prediction is a pivotal application of data science and machine learning that aims to estimate property values based on factors such as location, property features, market conditions, and neighborhood characteristics. Accurate predictions are essential for homeowners, investors, realtors, and policymakers to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or valuing properties. However, the process is challenging due to non-linear relationships between variables, the influence of external economic factors, and the need for high-quality data. Machine learning models, including regression techniques and neural networks, offer powerful tools to analyze complex datasets, uncover patterns, and adapt to changing market trends, making them indispensable for reliable house price estimation.
