Accurate prediction of house selling prices is essential for buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and policymakers in the real estate market. This project aims to develop a predictive model for house prices using advanced machine learning techniques. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset with features such as location, property size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and market conditions, we identify the key factors influencing house prices.
Our approach includes data preprocessing, feature selection, and the implementation of various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Additionally, we explore neural networks to enhance prediction accuracy. Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values.
The project's outcomes will provide insights into significant price predictors and offer a reliable tool for estimating house prices, aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions. This work demonstrates the potential of machine learning in real estate analytics and contributes to the field of predictive modelling.
